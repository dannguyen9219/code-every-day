/*
Problem 1
Write a function which accepts a base an an exponent. It should return the result of raising the base to that exponent. This function should mimic the functionality of Math.pow().
power(2,4) //16
power(3,2) //9
power(3,3) //27

*/

/*
Problem 2
Write a function factorial which accepts a number and returns the factorial of that number. Factorial zero is always 1.

*/

/*
Problem 3
Write a function called productOfArray which takes in an array of numbers and returns the product of them all.
productOfArray([1,2,3])    // 6
productOfArray([1,2,3,10]) // 60

*/

/*
Problem 4
Write a function called recrusiveRange which accepts a number and adds up all the numbers from 0 to the number passed to the function.
recursiveRange(6) // 21

*/

/*
Problem 5
Write a recursive function called fib which accepts a number and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... which starts with 1 and 1, and where every number thereafter is equal to the sume of the previous two numbers.
fib(4) // 3
fib(10) // 55
