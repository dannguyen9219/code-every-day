/*
Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

Algorithm - a process or set of steps to accompish a certain task. 

Why you need to know this? Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm. It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.
